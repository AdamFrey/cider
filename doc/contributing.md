### Issues

Report issues and suggest features and improvements on the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues). Don't ask
questions on the issue tracker - the mailing list and the IRC channel are the
places for questions.

If you want to file a bug, please clone this repo and provide sufficient details
to reproduce the issue. Start by running `make run-cider`.  This will bring up
Emacs with only the latest version of CIDER loaded. By starting fresh, with the
latest code, we can ensure that the problem at hand isn't already fixed or
caused by interactions with other packages.

### Patches

Patches in any form are always welcome! GitHub pull requests are even better! :-)

Before submitting a patch or a pull request make sure all tests are
passing and that your patch is in line with the [contribution
guidelines](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Documentation

### Running the tests in batch mode

Install [cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) if you haven't
already, then:

```
$ cd /path/to/cider
$ cask
```

Run all tests with:

```
$ make test
```

(Note: tests may not run correctly inside Emacs' `shell-mode` buffers. Running
them in a terminal is recommended.)

You can also check for the presence of byte-compilation warnings in batch mode:

```
$ make test-bytecomp
```
